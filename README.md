# CSC309-Web-Development
This project was developed by me for my web development course at university (AUL Lebanon).
The front-end consists of: HTML, CSS, & JAVASCRIPT.
The back-end consists of: PHP & MySQL.

# Acknowledgements
This project will definitely be updated in the future such as re-writing the whole source and using more updated technologies such as bootstrap & react for the front-end and either use laravel with php or completely use Node.JS & Express.JS for the back-end instead with PostegreSQL.

# Disclaimer
This project was NOT fully finished. The idea of this project is going to completely change in the future.
